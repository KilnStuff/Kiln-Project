# Kiln-Project

  In this guide we will detail our process and design for an electronic temperature controlled kiln. The goal of this project was to convert a manual temperature controlled kiln, which originally set the temperature by means of a knob, to a much more sophisticated electronic control system that could drive the kiln to a specific temperature based on thermocouple feedback. This project required us to wire and build the system from scratch, with the only previously constructed components being the kiln itself and our means to electronically communicate with the kiln, a raspberry pi (as well as peripherals for the pi).
